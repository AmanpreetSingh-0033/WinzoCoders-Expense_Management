## 🎯 **Key Features Explained**

### **Conditional Approval Logic**

**Example Scenario:**
```
Company: Acme Inc
Workflow Rules:
  - Percentage: 60%
  - CFO Override: Enabled
  - Hybrid Mode: Enabled

Approver Sequence:
  1. Manager (Alice)
  2. Finance (Bob)
  3. Director (Carol)
  4. CFO (David)
  5. VP (Eve)

Expense Submitted: $500 lunch

Approval Flow:
  Alice → APPROVED
  Bob → APPROVED
  Carol → APPROVED
  
  Check: 3/5 = 60% ✓
  Result: APPROVED (remaining approvers skipped)
```

**Alternative Scenario (CFO Override):**
```
Approval Flow:
  Alice → PENDING
  Bob → APPROVED
  Carol → PENDING
  David (CFO) → APPROVED
  
  Check: CFO approved ✓
  Result: APPROVED (CFO override triggered)
```

### **Currency Conversion**

**Example:**
```
Employee: John (USA)
Company: Acme Inc (USD)

John submits expense:
  Amount: €120.50
  Currency: EUR
  
System processes:
  1. Fetch EUR to USD rate: 1.085
  2. Convert: €120.50 × 1.085 = $130.74
  3. Store both amounts
  
Display:
  "€120.50 EUR ($130.74 USD)"
  
Manager sees:
  "$130.74 USD" (company base currency)
```

---

### **Manager-Employee Relationships**

**Setup:**
```
Admin creates users:
  - Alice (Manager)
  - John (Employee, manager: Alice)
  - Jane (Employee, manager: Alice)

Approval Sequence for John's expense:
  1. Alice (John's manager) ← First approver
  2. Finance
  3. Director
```
