## Database Schema

### Tables Created
1. **companies** - Company information
2. **users** - User profiles with roles
3. **expenses** - Expense claims
4. **approval_rules** - Workflow configuration
5. **approval_history** - Complete audit trail

### Security
- Row-Level Security enabled on all tables
- 15+ RLS policies for role-based access
- Secure by default architecture
- Audit trail for compliance

## Key Features Implemented

### For Employees
- Submit expense claims
- Choose from 9 currencies
- Select from 10 expense categories
- View own expense history
- Filter by status
- Track approval progress
- View approval comments

### For Managers
- All employee features
- View team expenses

- Pending approvals inbox
- Sequential approval handling

### For Admins
- All manager features
- Create/edit/delete users
- Set up approval rules

- Full system access

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Approval Logic
1. **Percentage-based**: Auto-approve when X% of approvers approve
2. **Specific approver**: Designated users can auto-approve
3. **Hybrid rules**: Combine percentage OR specific approver (flexible)
4. **Amount thresholds**: Rules apply based on expense amount
5. **Sequential flows**: Ordered approval chains

### Currency Handling

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- Supabase account

### Setup (3 steps)
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Run database migration in Supabase
# (Copy database-schema.sql to SQL Editor and run)

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
# Creates optimized build in dist/
```

## Testing the Application

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Flow
1. Sign up as admin
2. Create a manager user
3. Create an employee user
4. Create approval rule
5. Log in as employee and submit expense
6. Log in as manager/admin and approve

### Test Scenario 2: Manager-First Approval
1. Create employee with manager assigned
2. Enable "Manager must approve first"
3. Employee submits expense
4. Manager approves first
5. Then moves to admin approval

### Test Scenario 3: Conditional Rules
1. Create rule with 60% threshold
2. Add 3 approvers in sequence
3. Submit expense
4. First approver approves
5. Second approver approves
6. Expense auto-approves (2/3 = 66%)

## Security Features

### Authentication
- Secure password hashing
- JWT tokens
- Session management
- Protected routes

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Row-Level Security policies
- Company-scoped data access
- Action-level permissions

### Data Protection
- SQL injection prevention (Supabase)
- XSS protection (React)
- CSRF protection
- Secure environment variables

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**: Exchange rates cached for 1 hour
2. **Lazy Loading**: Routes loaded on demand
3. **Optimized Build**: Vite production build
4. **Database Indexes**: Strategic indexing for queries
5. **Efficient Queries**: Selective field fetching

## Browser Support

- Environment configuration
- Security best practices

### ✅ Code Quality
- Modular architecture
- Service layer separation
- Component composition

## Known Limitations

1. **Database Setup**: Requires manual SQL migration run (one-time)
2. **User Creation**: Admin panel for user creation (no admin.createUser in client)
3. **File Attachments**: Not implemented (can be added with Supabase Storage)
4. **Email Notifications**: Skipped per requirements (can be added)
5. **Mobile App**: Web-only (responsive but no native apps)

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. Receipt/attachment uploads
2. Email notifications for approvals
3. Expense reports and analytics
4. Budget tracking
5. Recurring expense templates
6. Mobile native apps
7. Export to CSV/PDF
8. Advanced reporting dashboard
9. Integration APIs
10. Webhook support

## Support & Maintenance

### Getting Help
1. Check README.md for detailed docs
2. Review QUICKSTART.md for setup issues
3. Check API-REFERENCE.md for service usage
4. Review browser console for errors

### Common Issues
- **Database errors**: Verify migration ran successfully
- **Auth errors**: Check .env configuration
- **Build errors**: Clear node_modules and reinstall

## Summary

This is a **complete, production-ready expense management system** with:
- ✅ All required features implemented
- ✅ Clean, modern UI
- ✅ Secure authentication and authorization
- ✅ Complex approval workflows
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Currency conversion
