## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Manager Must Approve First
When creating/editing an employee:
1. Set their manager
2. Check "Manager must approve first"
3. Now all their expenses go to manager first

### Workflow 2: Percentage-Based Approval
Create a rule with:
- Percentage threshold: 60
- Add 3 approvers in sequence
- When 2 out of 3 approve (60%+), expense auto-approves

### Workflow 3: CFO Auto-Approval
Create a rule with:
- Add specific approver (CFO user ID)
- When CFO approves, expense auto-approves regardless of others

### Workflow 4: Hybrid Rule
Create a rule with:
- Percentage threshold: 60
- Specific approver: CFO
- Check "Hybrid Rule"
- Now EITHER 60% approval OR CFO approval triggers auto-approval
