# ✅ Dashboard Redirect Fix - Role-Based Navigation

## 🎯 **Issue Fixed**

Admin users were seeing tabs for Employee, Manager, and Admin on the `/dashboard` page. Now, each role is automatically redirected to their specific dashboard.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Changed**

### **File Modified:** `client/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Showed tabs for all roles
<Tabs defaultValue={role} className="w-full">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="EMPLOYEE">Employee</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="MANAGER">Manager</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="ADMIN">Admin</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  {/* Content for each tab */}
</Tabs>
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Auto-redirects to role-specific dashboard
const roleRoutes: Record<string, string> = {
  ADMIN: "/admin/dashboard",
  MANAGER: "/manager/dashboard",
  FINANCE: "/manager/dashboard",
  DIRECTOR: "/manager/dashboard",
  CFO: "/manager/dashboard",
  EMPLOYEE: "/employee/dashboard",
};

const redirectPath = roleRoutes[user.role] || "/employee/dashboard";
return <Navigate to={redirectPath} replace />;
```

---

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Automatic Role-Based Redirection:**

```
User visits /dashboard
  ↓
System checks user role
  ↓
Redirects to appropriate dashboard:
  - Admin → /admin/dashboard
  - Manager → /manager/dashboard
  - Finance → /manager/dashboard
  - Director → /manager/dashboard
  - CFO → /manager/dashboard
  - Employee → /employee/dashboard
```
