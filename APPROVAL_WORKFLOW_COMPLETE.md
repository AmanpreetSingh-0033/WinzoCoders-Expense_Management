# Complete Approval Workflow Implementation

## ✅ All Requirements Implemented

### **1. Manager-First Approval with Toggle (IS_MANAGER_APPROVER)**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Admin can now control whether manager approval is required

**Configuration:**
```typescript
{
  requireManagerApproval: true  // Manager must approve first (default)
  requireManagerApproval: false // Skip manager, go directly to role-based approvers
}
```

**How it works:**
```javascript
// server/routes/expenses.ts
const managerId = db.users[user.sub]?.managerId || null;
const includeManager = rules?.requireManagerApproval !== false && managerId;

// If requireManagerApproval = true AND employee has manager:
//   → Manager added as first approver
// If requireManagerApproval = false:
//   → Manager skipped, goes directly to Finance → Director → CFO
```

---

### **2. Complete Approval Sequence (Manager → Finance → Director → CFO)**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Full approval chain including CFO

**Approver Sequence:**
```
Step 1: Manager (if requireManagerApproval = true AND employee has manager)
Step 2: Finance (if exists in company)
Step 3: Director (if exists in company)
Step 4: CFO (if exists in company)
```

**Code:**
```typescript
const approverSequence = [
  includeManager ? managerId : null,
  finance?.id,
  director?.id,
  cfo?.id  // ✅ NOW INCLUDED
].filter(Boolean) as string[];
```

---

### **3. Sequential Approval Flow**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Expenses move through approvers one by one

**How it works:**
1. Expense created with `currentApproverIndex = 0`
2. First approver (index 0) can approve/reject
3. After approval, `currentApproverIndex` increments to 1
4. Next approver (index 1) can now approve/reject
5. Continues until all approve or one rejects

**Protection:**
```typescript
// Only current approver can make decision
const idx = expense.currentApproverIndex;
const approverId = expense.approverSequence[idx];
if (approverId !== user.sub) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: "Not your turn to approve" });
}
```

---

### **4. Conditional Approval Rules**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Three powerful approval modes

#### **A. Percentage Rule**
```javascript
{
  percentage: 0.6,      // 60% threshold
  cfoOverride: false,
  hybrid: false
}

// Logic:
if (approvedCount / totalApprovers >= 0.6) {
  expense.status = "APPROVED";  // Auto-approve, skip remaining approvers
}
```

**Example:**
```
Approvers: [Manager, Finance, Director, CFO, VP] = 5 people
Approved: [✓ Manager, ✓ Finance, ✓ Director] = 3 people
Ratio: 3/5 = 60%
Result: ✅ APPROVED (threshold met, CFO and VP skipped)
```

---

#### **B. CFO Override Rule**
```javascript
{
  percentage: 1.0,
  cfoOverride: true,    // CFO auto-approves
  hybrid: false
}

// Logic:
if (cfoApproved) {
  expense.status = "APPROVED";  // Instant approval
}
```

**Example:**
```
Approvers: [Manager, Finance, Director, CFO]
Decisions: [PENDING, APPROVED, PENDING, APPROVED]
CFO Approved: ✅ Yes
Result: ✅ APPROVED (CFO override, Director skipped)
```

---

#### **C. Hybrid Mode (RECOMMENDED)**
```javascript
{
  percentage: 0.6,
  cfoOverride: true,
  hybrid: true          // Use percentage OR CFO
}

// Logic:
if (approvedCount / totalApprovers >= 0.6 || cfoApproved) {
  expense.status = "APPROVED";
}
```

**Example 1: Percentage Met**
```
Approvers: 5 people
Approved: 3 people (60%)
CFO: Not yet approved
Result: ✅ APPROVED (percentage condition met)
```

**Example 2: CFO Override**
```
Approvers: 5 people
Approved: 2 people (40%)
CFO: ✓ Approved
Result: ✅ APPROVED (CFO condition met)
```

---

### **5. Multiple Approvers + Conditional Flow Combined**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Both systems work together

**How they combine:**

```
1. Employee submits expense
2. System creates sequence: [Manager, Finance, Director, CFO]
3. Manager approves (1/4 = 25%)
4. Finance approves (2/4 = 50%)
5. Director approves (3/4 = 75%)
   
   → IF percentage rule = 60%:
     ✅ APPROVED at this point (75% > 60%)
     CFO never gets the request
   
   → IF CFO override enabled AND CFO approved at step 4:
     ✅ APPROVED immediately
     Director never gets the request
```

## 🎨 Admin UI Features

### **Workflow Configuration Dialog**

Admin can configure all rules in one place:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Workflow Configuration                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                 │
│ Approval Percentage Threshold                   │
│ [0.6                                        ]   │
│ Example: 0.6 means 60% of approvers must approve│

│ ☑ CFO Override                                 │
│   CFO approval automatically approves expense   │
│                                                 │
│ ☑ Hybrid Mode                                  │
│   Use percentage OR CFO override                │

## 📋 Complete Workflow Examples

### **Example 1: Traditional Sequential Flow**

**Settings:**
```javascript
{
  requireManagerApproval: true,
  percentage: 1.0,          // 100% - all must approve
  cfoOverride: false,
  hybrid: false
}
```

**Flow:**
```
Employee submits → Manager → Finance → Director → CFO
All 4 must approve for final approval
```

---

### **Example 2: Skip Manager, Use Percentage**

**Settings:**
```javascript
{
  requireManagerApproval: false,  // Skip manager
  percentage: 0.5,                 // 50% threshold
  cfoOverride: false,
  hybrid: false
}
```

**Flow:**
```
Employee submits → Finance → Director → CFO
2 out of 3 approve = APPROVED (50% threshold met)
```

---

### **Example 3: Manager + CFO Override (Recommended)**

**Settings:**
```javascript
{
  requireManagerApproval: true,
  percentage: 0.6,
  cfoOverride: true,
  hybrid: true
}
```

**Flow:**
```
Employee submits → Manager → Finance → Director → CFO

Scenario A: Manager + Finance approve
  → 2/4 = 50% (below 60%, continue)
  → Director approves
  → 3/4 = 75% ✅ APPROVED

Scenario B: Manager approves, Finance rejects
  → ❌ REJECTED immediately

Scenario C: Manager + Finance approve, CFO approves at step 4
  → CFO override ✅ APPROVED immediately
  → Director skipped
```
