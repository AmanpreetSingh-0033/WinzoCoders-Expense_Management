# 🔍 OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Feature

## ✅ Automatic Receipt Text Extraction

Your Expence Flow application now has **automatic OCR** that extracts text from receipt images!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Processing
When an employee uploads a receipt image:
1. ✅ **Upload Image** - Employee selects an image file (JPG, PNG, etc.)
2. ✅ **Auto-Scan** - OCR automatically extracts text from the image
3. ✅ **Auto-Fill** - System extracts amount, date, and description
4. ✅ **Review** - Employee reviews and edits the extracted information
5. ✅ **Submit** - Employee submits the expense

---

## 🚀 Features

### Automatic Extraction
- **Triggered on Upload**: OCR runs automatically when an image is uploaded
- **Amount Detection**: Finds and extracts monetary amounts
- **Date Recognition**: Detects dates in multiple formats (YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY, etc.)
- **Description**: Extracts text content for description field
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows "Processing..." indicator during extraction

### Manual Controls
- **Re-scan Button**: Reprocess the receipt if extraction wasn't perfect
- **Apply to Form Button**: Manually apply extracted text to form fields
- **Edit Extracted Text**: Edit the OCR text before applying to form

### Smart Processing
- **Image Only**: Only processes image files (JPG, PNG, WEBP, etc.)
- **PDF Notice**: Notifies users that OCR works with images only
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles OCR failures
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during processing

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Technology

- **Processing**: Client-side (browser)
- **No Server Required**: All OCR happens in the user's browser

### Supported Formats
- ✅ **Images**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP, GIF, BMP
- ❌ **PDFs**: Not supported (use image conversion tools)

### Extraction Patterns

**Amount Detection**:
```javascript
/\d+[\.,]?\d*/  // Matches: 45.50, 45,50, 45
```

**Date Detection**:
```javascript
/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}|\d{2}[\/.-]\d{2}[\/.-]\d{4}/
// Matches: 2025-01-04, 04/01/2025, 04-01-2025, 04.01.2025
```

### Performance
- **First Load**: ~2-3 seconds (loads Tesseract.js worker)
- **Subsequent Scans**: ~1-2 seconds
- **File Size**: Works best with images < 5MB
- **Resolution**: Better results with higher quality images

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Image Quality**
   - Use clear, well-lit photos
   - Avoid blurry or low-resolution images
   - Ensure text is readable

2. **Image Format**
   - Take photo straight-on (not at an angle)
   - Include entire receipt in frame
   - Avoid shadows and reflections

3. **File Size**
   - Compress large images before upload
   - Optimal size: 1-5 MB
   - Maximum recommended: 10 MB

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Text not extracted correctly
- **Solution**: Use "Re-scan Receipt" button
- **Solution**: Edit extracted text manually
- **Solution**: Try a clearer photo

**Problem**: No text extracted
- **Solution**: Ensure file is an image (not PDF)
- **Solution**: Check if receipt text is clearly visible
- **Solution**: Try a different image

**Problem**: Wrong amount or date
- **Solution**: Edit the Amount and Date fields directly
- **Solution**: OCR extracts the first number it finds - verify it's correct
